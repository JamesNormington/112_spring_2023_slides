##  {.unnumbered .smaller}

```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, error = TRUE, tidy = FALSE, message = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(mosaicData)
library(lubridate)
library(babynames)
BabyNames <- babynames
colnames(BabyNames)[4] <- "count"
```

## Due this Week {.unnumbered .smaller}

-   At least 1 Tidy Tuesday by next Friday!

## Learning Goals {.unnumbered}

-   Understand the difference between wide and long data format and distinguish the case (unit of observation) for a given data set
-   Develop comfort in using `pivot_wider` and `pivot_longer` in the `tidyr` package

## Template File {.unnumbered}

Download a template .Rmd of this activity. Put the file in a `Day_08` folder within your `COMP_STAT_112` folder.

-   This .Rmd only contains examples and 3 exercises that we'll work on in class and you'll finish for Assignment 7.

## Describe to your Neighbor {.unnumbered .smaller}

Everyone: Look at this small data set.

Partner A: Describe the structure of the data set in words.

```{r echo=FALSE}
BabyTotal <-  BabyNames %>%
  group_by(name, sex) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(count))

knitr::kable(
  BabyTotal %>% filter(name %in% c('Courtney','Riley'))
)
```

## Describe to your Neighbor {.unnumbered .smaller}

Partner A: Close your eyes.

Partner B: Describe the how the *structure* of the data set changed. Think of describing "steps" taken.

Partner A: Sketch what you think the new data set looks like.

. . .

```{r echo=FALSE}
smallWideBaby <- BabyTotal  %>% filter(name %in% c('Courtney','Riley')) %>% pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = total, values_fill = 0, names_sort = TRUE)
knitr::kable(
  smallWideBaby
)
```

Partner B: Sketch what you think the new data set looks like.

. . .

```{r echo=FALSE}
smallLongBaby <- smallWideBaby %>% mutate(ratio = pmin(F/M,M/F)) %>% pivot_longer(cols = c(`F`, `M`), names_to = "sex", values_to = "total")

knitr::kable(
  smallWideBaby %>% mutate(ratio = pmin(F/M,M/F))
)

knitr::kable(
  smallLongBaby
)
```

## Wider V. Longer Format {.unnumbered}

If we want to maintain all of the values in the data set (*not collapsing rows with `summarize`*) but have a different unit of observation (or case), we can:

. . .

-   Make the data **wider** by spreading out the values across new variables (e.g. total counts for binary "Male" and "Female" names)

. . .

-   Make the data **longer** by combining values from different variables into 1 variable (take counts for binary "Male" and "Female" names and combine into one total column)

## R Functions {.unnumbered}

`pivot_wider()`

-   Inputs: data, names_from = var_name, values_from = var_name

`pivot_longer()`

-   Inputs: data, cols = c(`var_name2`, `var_name2`), names_to = "string", values_to = "string"

## In Class {.unnumbered}

Go through the example code in the Rmd file to make sure you understand how we reshape data to be wider and longer.

-   Work together on the 3 exercises to turn in for Assignment xx.

## After Class {.unnumbered}

-   TT4
