## Project Discussions

1.  Sit with project groups
2.  Discuss as a group

-   Project ideas and interest
    -   Come to consensus on a direction (everyone is on board, even if not their first choice)
-   Project facilitating roles
    -   Facilitator (set up times to meet outside of class)
    -   Communication manager (set up systems below; reach out to members/faculty as needed)
    -   Reflector/Delegator (thinking about equity and making sure tasks get divided, make sure people get a chance to work on building skills)
-   Communication system
    -   How are you going to share ideas and progress? (Slack DM group? Google Doc?)
    -   How are you going to share code? (Google Drive Folder? Github?)

3.  If you'd like to adjust groups, send me an email after class
4.  If you'd like to share feedback about a group member, but wish to remain anonymous, please use the Anonymous Feedback Form.
