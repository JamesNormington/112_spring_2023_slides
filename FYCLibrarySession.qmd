## Article Summary

A recent study was the first to quantify the diversity of artists at U.S. art museums [@heggeseth2019]. 

@heggeseth2013 studied mixture models for clustering longitudinal data and offered an alternative solution when trying to cluster by growth pattern.

Together these studies [@heggeseth2013; @heggeseth2019] were really interesting!
