## Announcements {.unnumbered}

## Learning Goals {.unnumbered}

-   Understand how we can use additional aesthetics such as color and size to incorporate a third (or more variables) to a bivariate plot
-   Develop comfort with interpreting heat maps and star plots, which allow you to look for patterns in variation in many variables.

## Template File {.unnumbered}

Download a template .Rmd of this activity. Put the file in a `Day_05` folder within your `COMP_STAT_112` folder.

-   This .Rmd only contains exercises that we'll work on in class and you'll finish for Assignment 4.


## More Aesthetic Attributes {.unnumbered}

To go beyond 2 variables, we need to add aesthetics for each new variable!

## Data: Exploring SAT Scores {.smaller}

Though far from a perfect assessment of academic preparedness, SAT scores have historically been used as one measurement of a state's education system.

<br> 
```{r echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
education <- read.csv("https://www.macalester.edu/~ajohns24/data/sat.csv")
```
<br>
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  education[1:6, ],
  caption = "The first few rows of the SAT data."
)
```

## Data: Codebook {.smaller}

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="750px",fig.cap="Codebook for SAT data. Source: https://www.macalester.edu/~kaplan/ISM/datasets/data-documentation.pdf"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/SATcodebook.png")
```

## Univariate Density {.smaller}

Variability in average SAT scores from state to state:

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(education, aes(x = sat)) +
  geom_density(fill = "blue", alpha = .5) + theme_classic()
```

## Bivariate Scatterplot {.smaller}

What degree do per pupil spending (`expend`) and teacher `salary` *explain* this variability?

.  .  .
 
<br>

```{r echo=TRUE}
#| layout-ncol: 2
  
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm") + theme_classic()

ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = expend)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm") + theme_classic()
```

Is there anything that surprises you in the above plots? What are the relationship trends?

## Exercise: Three Variables {.smaller .scrollable}

Make a single scatterplot visualization that demonstrates the relationship between `sat`, `salary`, and `expend`.

*Hints:*

*1. Try using the color or size aesthetics to incorporate the expenditure data.*

*2. Include some model smooths with `geom_smooth()` to help highlight the trends.*

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
  
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = expend)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm") + theme_classic()
```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
  
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = expend)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm") + theme_classic()
```

## Exercise: Three Variables {.smaller .scrollable}

Another option!

Categorize your 3rd Quantitative Variable!


```{r}
#| echo: true
education %>% 
  mutate(expendCat = cut(expend,3)) %>%
ggplot(aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = expendCat)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm") + theme_classic()
```


## Exercise: Fraction who take SAT {.smaller .scrollable}

The `fracCat` variable in the `education` data categorizes the fraction of the state's students that take the SAT into `low` (below 15%), `medium` (15-45%), and `high` (at least 45%).

a.  Make a univariate visualization of the `fracCat` variable to better understand how many states fall into each category.

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
  
ggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat)) +
  geom_bar() + theme_classic()
```

## Exercise: Fraction who take SAT {.smaller .scrollable}

b.  Make a bivariate visualization that demonstrates the relationship between `fracCat` and `sat`. What story does your graphic tell?

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
  
ggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat, y = sat)) +
  geom_boxplot() + theme_classic()
```

## Exercise: Fraction who take SAT {.smaller .scrollable}

c.  Make a trivariate visualization that demonstrates the relationship between `fracCat`, `sat`, and `expend`. Incorporate `fracCat` as the color of each point, and use a single call to `geom_smooth` to add three trendlines (one for each `fracCat`). What story does your graphic tell?

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
  
ggplot(education, aes(color = fracCat, y = sat, x = expend)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = 'lm') + theme_classic()
```

## Exercise: Fraction who take SAT {.smaller}

d.  Putting all of this together, explain this example of **Simpson's Paradox**. That is, why does it appear that SAT scores decrease as spending increases even though the opposite is true?

Discuss!

## Other Multivariate Visualization Techniques {.unnumbered}

## Heat maps {.smaller .scrollable}

Note that each variable (column) is scaled to indicate states (rows) with high values (yellow) to low values (purple/blue).

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=20, cache=TRUE}
ed <- as.data.frame(education) # convert from tibble to data frame

# convert to a matrix with State names as the row names
row.names(ed) <- ed$State 
ed <- ed[, 2:8]
ed_mat <- data.matrix(ed)

gplots::heatmap.2(ed_mat,
  Rowv = NA, Colv = NA, scale = "column",
  keysize = 0.7, density.info = "none",
  col = hcl.colors(256), margins = c(10, 20),
  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),
  sepcolor = "white", cexRow = 2, cexCol = 2, trace = "none",
  dendrogram = "none"
)
```

What do you notice? What insight do you gain about the variation across U.S. states?

## Heat maps with Row Cluster {.smaller .scrollable}

Include *dendrograms* helps to identify interesting clusters.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=20, cache=TRUE}
gplots::heatmap.2(ed_mat,
  Colv = NA, scale = "column", keysize = .7,
  density.info = "none", col = hcl.colors(256),
  margins = c(10, 20),
  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),
  sepcolor = "white", cexRow = 2, cexCol = 2, trace = "none",
  dendrogram = "row"
)
```

What do you notice? What new insight do you gain about the variation across U.S. states, now that states are grouped and ordered to represent similarity?

## Heat maps with Column Cluster {.smaller .scrollable}

We can also construct a heat map which identifies interesting clusters of columns (variables).

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=20, cache=TRUE}
gplots::heatmap.2(ed_mat,
  Rowv = NA, scale = "column", keysize = .7,
  density.info = "none", col = hcl.colors(256),
  margins = c(10, 20),
  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),
  sepcolor = "white", cexRow = 2, cexCol = 2, trace = "none",
  dendrogram = "column"
)
```

What do you notice? What new insight do you gain about the variation across U.S. states, now that variables are grouped and ordered to represent similarity?

## Star plots {.unnumbered .scrollable}

Star plot visualizations indicate the relative scale of each variable for each state.

```{r, fig.width=15, fig.height=18, cache=TRUE}
stars(ed_mat,
  flip.labels = FALSE,
  key.loc = c(15, 1.5), cex = 1.5
)
```

What do you notice? What new insight do you gain about the variation across U.S. states with the star plots?

## Star plots {.unnumbered .scrollable}

Star plot visualizations indicate the relative scale of each variable for each state.

```{r, fig.width=15, fig.height=18, cache=TRUE}
stars(ed_mat,
  flip.labels = FALSE,
  key.loc = c(15, 1.5), cex = 1.5, draw.segments = TRUE
)
```
