## Big Data

![Four Components of Big Data](images/ibm.png){fig-alt="Main components of data as volume, velocity, variety, and veracity" fig-align="center"}

## Data Science in Liberal Arts

The liberal arts setting provides an opportunity to synthesize ***lenses for data*** developed in the social and hard sciences, humanities, and fine arts

-   Data Science applies these lenses to extract knowledge from data within a particular domain of inquiry such as
    -   educational policy making,
    -   ecological modeling,
    -   journalism,
    -   computational linguistics, etc.

## Skills

## Data Science Jobs

-   Government agencies (e.g., NSA, CIA)
-   Science institutions (e.g., NASA, NIH)
-   Companies/divisions specializing in data analysis (e.g., IBM)

## Learning Goals

By the end of the course, you'll be able to:

::: incremental
-   Appreciate the role of data science in a wide range of disciplines
-   Identify, collect, and wrangle data from multiple sources
-   Conduct basic exploratory statistical analyses
-   Find code online and adapt it to your given task
-   Using iterative refinement and teamwork, take a data science project from concept to reality
-   Communicate your results so that they're reproducible and accessible for a broad audience
:::

## Community of Learners

::: incremental
**Target Audience.**

-   No matter your statistics and coding background (no experience to expert) or major and interests, this course is for YOU!

**Learn by doing.**

-   Learning by doing entails getting stuck, making mistakes, asking questions, and getting feedback.
:::
