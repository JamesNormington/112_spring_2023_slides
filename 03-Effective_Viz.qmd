## Announcements {.unnumbered}

-   

## Learning Goals {.unnumbered}

-   Understand and apply the guiding principles of effective visualizations

## Benefits of Visualizations {.smaller}

Visualizations help us understand what we're working with:

-   What are the scales of our variables?
-   Are there any outliers, i.e. unusual cases?
-   What are the patterns among our variables?

This understanding will inform our next steps:

-   What method of analysis / model is appropriate?

<br> Once our analysis is complete, visualizations are a powerful way to communicate our findings and tell a story.

## Template File {.unnumbered}

Download a template .Rmd of this activity. Put the file in a `Day_03` folder within your `COMP_STAT_112` folder.

-   This .Rmd only contains exercises that we'll work on in class (no assignment).

## Analysis of Graphics {.unnumbered}

There is not one *right* way to visualize a data set.

Let's try some critical analysis on specific examples.

<br>

Identify the following:

1.  the story the graphic is aiming to communicate to the audience
2.  effective features of the graphic
3.  areas for improvement

## Example 1 {.unnumbered}

## Example 2 {.unnumbered}

## Properties of Effective Visualizations {.unnumbered}

1.  Tells a Story

> Graphics are designed by the human expert (you!) in order to reveal information that's in the data.

You should clearly identify what story you want the graphic to tell to the audience, and double check that this story is being told.

2.  Ethical

> Data visualizations have a potentially enormous influence on how data are used to make decisions across all areas of human endeavor. - Michael Correll

-   **Visibility** Make the invisible (labor, uncertainty, impact) visible

-   **Privacy** Collect data with empathy

-   **Power** Challenge structures of power

At a minimum, you should always:

-   Present data in a way that avoids misleading the audience.

-   Always include your data source. Doing so attributes credit for labor, provides credibility to your work, and provides context for your graphic.

3.  Use good design to facilitate comparison

> Good graphics make it easy for people to perceive things that are similar and things that are different.

Humans can perceive and compare nearby objects based on the aesthetics (roughly descending order of ability):

1.  Position
2.  Length
3.  Angle
4.  Direction
5.  Shape (but only a very few different shapes)
6.  Area
7.  Volume
8.  Shade
9.  Color

## Visual Perception {.smaller}

1.  Visual perception is selective, and our attention is often drawn to constrasts from the norm.

```{r,echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%',fig.fullwidth=TRUE,fig.cap="Our attention is drawn to contrasts to the norm. What stands out in this example image?, which is originally from C. Ware, *Information Visualization: Perception for Design*, 2004? Source: S. Few, *Now You See It*, 2009, p. 33."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/contrast.png")
```

> **Implication**: We should design visualizations so that the features we want to highlight stand out in contrast from those that are not worth the audience's attention.

## Visual Perception {.smaller}

2.  Our eyes are drawn to familiar patterns. We see what we know and expect.

```{r,echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%',fig.fullwidth=TRUE,fig.cap="Do you see anything embedded in this rose image from coolbubble.com? Source: S. Few, *Now You See It*, 2009, p. 34."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rose1.png")
```

> **Implication**: Visualizations work best when they display information as patterns that familiar and easy to spot.

## Visual Perception {.smaller}

3.  Memory plays an important role in human cognition, but working memory is extremely limited.

> **Implication**: Visualizations must serve as external aids to augment working memory.

## Basic Rules for Constructing Graphics {.unnumbered}

-   Each quantitative variable requires a new axis.\
-   Each categorical variable requires a new way to "group" the graphic (eg: using colors, shapes, separate facets, etc to capture the grouping).
-   For visualizations in which overlap in glyphs or plots obscures the patterns, try faceting or transparency.

## Exercise {.smaller}

Exercise 2. Consider one of the more complicated data graphics from [Exercise 2.5](http://mdsr-book.github.io/exercises.html#exercise_25):

a.  What story does the data graphic tell? What is the main message that you take away from it?

b.  Can the data graphic be described in terms of the Grammer of Graphics (frame, glyphs, aesthetics, facet, scale, guide)? If so, please describe.

c.  Critique and/or praise the visualization choices made by the designer. 
  - Do they work? 
  - Are they misleading? 
  - Thought-provoking? 
  - Brilliant? 
  - Are there things that you would have done differently? Justify your response.
