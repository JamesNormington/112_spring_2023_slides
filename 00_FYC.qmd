## Introductions {.smaller}

As we gather, introduce yourself (you choose what you share) to others at your table.

<br>

Here are some suggestions:

-   Your preferred name (+ pronunciation tips)
-   Aspects of who you are and have been (*e.g. pronouns, geographical identity, cultural identity*)
-   Aspects of who you'd like to be (*e.g. personal/professional/academic goals*)
-   Questions that you have about Macalester
-   How you are feeling about everything (!?!)

*Be prepared to introduce one other person to the larger class*

## Important Note

You are expected to check your Macalester email regularly (at least once a daily).

*You will miss really important information related to your academic and social life if you don't.*

<br> <br> *We can talk later about how to have appropriate boundaries with technology such as email.*
