## Preparation {.unnumbered .smaller}

1.  Watch a [12 minute video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XPZxl_eM7FsXKj-5U7x8OAaIAS6Q4wM6/view?usp=sharing) before class starts (or at the beginning of class).

2.  Sit with people you don't know well. Introduce yourself and discuss/assign group roles:

-   Facilitator: Make sure the group makes progress on the task
-   Reflector: Make sure that everyone in the group contributes positive; encourage participation from everyone (e.g. What do you think? Any ideas?)
-   Resource Manager: Make sure the group seeks out the resources it needs to complete the task
-   Communicator Manager: Take responsibility to facilitate communication with each other and to the larger class/instructor
