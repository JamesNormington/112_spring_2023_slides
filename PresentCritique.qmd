## Effective Visuals {.smaller}

Let's review from the first half of the semester:

-   Be ethical and honest
-   Consider glyph choice
    -   easy or hard to perceive?
-   Consider color choices
    -   color blind friendly? cultural associations?
-   Facilitate comparison
    -   e.g. position through order on axis or faceting, calculate and present the difference or ratio
-   Use contrasts to draw attention
    -   e.g. yellow, red, orange draw attention in nature of green, brown, blue

## Presenting a Visual {.smaller}

When preparing to present a visualization, consider:

-   What context does the audience need to understand the visual? (W's?)
-   Does the visual have enough text annotation and guides to be understood with minimal explanation?
-   What aspects of the visual should you explain to provide necessary orientation?
    -   Walk through guides (axes, color legend, etc.)
-   What aspects of the visual do you want to draw attention to?
    -   What comparison are you wanting to highlight?

## Today

In groups of 3-4 people,

-   you'll present your visualization (2 minutes)
-   discuss as a group ways of improving the visualization to make it more effective (8 minutes)
    -   comment on the good features of the graphic first
    -   offer concrete suggestions about the visualization
    -   offer ideas and questions that you have about the visual and data

*Once your group is done, use this time to update your graphic based on that feedback.*
