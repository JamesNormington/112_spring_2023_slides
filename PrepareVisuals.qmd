## Effective Visuals {.smaller}

-   Be ethical and honest

-   Consider glyph choice

    -   easy or hard to perceive?

-   Consider color choices

    -   color blind friendly? cultural associations?

-   Facilitate comparison

    -   e.g. position through order on axis or faceting, calculate and present the difference or ratio

-   Use contrasts to draw attention

    -   e.g. yellow, red, orange draw attention in nature of green, brown, blue

## Presenting a Visual {.smaller}

When preparing to present a visualization, consider:

-   What context does the audience need to understand the visual? (W's?)
-   Does the visual have enough text annotation and guides to be understood with minimal explanation?
-   What aspects of the visual should you explain to provide necessary orientation?
    -   Walk through guides (axes, color legend, etc.)
-   What aspects of the visual do you want to draw attention to?
    -   What comparison are you wanting to highlight?

## Preparing for this Week

-   Create 1 effective visualization from your project data that tells a story
    -   Each person in a project group should make their own unique visualization
-   Prepare a 2 minute oral presentation (orientation and explanation) of your visualization.
    -   Consider the questions on the last slide.

## Tuesday, April 18th in class

In small groups of 4 people,

-   you'll present your visualization (2 minutes)
-   discuss as a group ways of improving the visualization to make it more effective (8 minutes)

Each of the 4 individuals will take a turn to present.

## Today

Consult with your project group and work on creating a visualization, or work on One Number Story
