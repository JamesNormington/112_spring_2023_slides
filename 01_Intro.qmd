## 

While we wait....

-   Sit next to people you don't know!

## Introductions {.smaller}

Introduce yourself to your neighbors!

<br>

Here are some things you can share, if you choose:

-   Your preferred name (+ pronunciation tips)
-   Aspects of who you are and have been (*e.g. pronouns, geographical identity, cultural identity, hobbies/passions*)
-   Aspects of who you'd like to be (*e.g. personal/professional/academic goals*)
-   How you are feeling about COMP/STAT 112? Is this a requirement for your degree, an academic interest, or both?
-   Anything else?

## What is data science?

-   Data science is the process to gain insights from data. The practitioners of data science (data scientists) combine statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to collect, clean, and analyze data, and present results to stakeholders.

## What is the difference between data science and statistics?

-   Data scientists are concerned with the entire life-cycle of a data analytic question -- from data collection/acquisition, data storage, data cleaning, data analysis, and presentation of results.

-   Statisticians are mostly concerned with data analysis. Statisticians use linear algebra, probability theory, and statistical modeling to best mimic a data generation process and explain relationships between variables.

## What is the difference between data science and statistics?

-   Data scientists often rely on models and algorithms created by statisticians (and, more recently, computer scientists!). Statisticians often rely on data scientists to provide clean, analytic-ready data.

-   "Data scientist" and "statistician" are not mutually exclusive titles, either. One title may suit you better, depending on who you are talking to.

## Data Science in Liberal Arts

The liberal arts setting provides an opportunity to synthesize ***lenses for data*** developed in the social and hard sciences, humanities, and fine arts

-   Data Science applies these lenses to **extract knowledge from data** within a particular domain of inquiry and contexts such as
    -   educational policy making,
    -   ecological modeling,
    -   journalism,
    -   computational linguistics, etc.

## Course Details

[Syllabus](https://jamesnormington.github.io/files/COMP_STAT%20112%20Spring%202023%20Syllabus.pdf)

-   Learning Goals
-   Community of Learners
-   Course Components
-   Communication
-   Environment You Deserve

## Learning Goals

**Overall Learning Goal**

Gain *confidence* in carrying out the entire data science pipeline,

-   from research question formulation,
-   to data collection/scraping,
-   to wrangling,
-   to modeling,
-   to visualization,
-   to presentation and communication

## Learning Goals

**Overall Learning Goal**

Gain *confidence* in carrying out the entire data science pipeline,

[![](images/lego.png){fig-alt="One visual representation of the pipeline with legos. The first step is data collection with a pile of legos. The second step is a data preparation with the legos separated by color. The third step is data visualization with legos separated and organized by color and type so you can more easily understand what’s happening. The fourth step is data analysis in which legos are put together into some creation such as roof, lawn, etc. Lastly, the final step is data storytelling in which someone is playing with a lego house." width="550"}](https://www.effectivedatastorytelling.com/post/a-deeper-dive-into-lego-bricks-and-data-stories)
