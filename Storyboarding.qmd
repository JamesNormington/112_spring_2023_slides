## Storyboarding

[What is a Storyboard?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard)

Open the [template file](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bFOJaTIm_kNDiJ_8KLIyXzXkWDFbQyeCH3siSkRVivE/edit?usp=sharing).

## Today {.smaller}

1.  Make one copy of this document for your project group (all members + Brianna should get editing access)

2.  Each persons should

-   copy the template slide \[3rd slide\] and insert a screenshot of a visual/table for the project
-   for each visual/table, add important message (top) and why it matters (bottom)

**Important Message**: a 1 sentence summary of what is the most insightful finding of the visual

**Why it matters**: few sentence description of why the audience should care and what they might do with that insight

3.  Discuss the order of the slides to tell the broader narrative

*Use this activity to work through ideas for how to tell the data story (in written and oral formats)*

## After Class {.unnumbered}

-   Work on Final Project!
