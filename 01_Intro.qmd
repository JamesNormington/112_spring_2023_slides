## Introductions {.smaller}

As we gather, sit with people you don't know well and introduce yourself (*you choose what you share*) to others at your table.

<br>

Here are some suggestions:

-   Your preferred name (+ pronunciation tips)
-   Aspects of who you are and have been (*e.g. pronouns, geographical identity, cultural identity, hobbies/passions*)
-   Aspects of who you'd like to be (*e.g. personal/professional/academic goals*)
-   How you are feeling about new semester (!?!)

*Be prepared to introduce one other person to the larger class*

## Big Data

![Four Components of Big Data](images/ibm.png){fig-alt="Main components of data as volume, velocity, variety, and veracity" fig-align="center"}

## Data Science in Liberal Arts

The liberal arts setting provides an opportunity to synthesize ***lenses for data*** developed in the social and hard sciences, humanities, and fine arts

. . .

-   Data Science applies these lenses to **extract knowledge from data** within a particular domain of inquiry and contexts such as
    -   educational policy making,
    -   ecological modeling,
    -   journalism,
    -   computational linguistics, etc.

## Data Science Skills

## Course Details

[Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B_ontyO8GhUwwaKb4WRG8g-xM1B2avlgvm3d92_fBfw/edit)

-   Learning Goals
-   Community of Learners
-   Course Components
-   Communication
-   Environment You Deserve

## Learning Goals

**Overall Learning Goal**

Gain *confidence* in carrying out the entire data science pipeline,

-   from research question formulation,
-   to data collection/scraping,
-   to wrangling,
-   to modeling,
-   to visualization,
-   to presentation and communication

## Learning Goals

**Overall Learning Goal**

Gain *confidence* in carrying out the entire data science pipeline,

[![](images/lego.png){fig-alt="One visual representation of the pipeline with legos. The first step is data collection with a pile of legos. The second step is a data preparation with the legos separated by color. The third step is data visualization with legos separated and organized by color and type so you can more easily understand what’s happening. The fourth step is data analysis in which legos are put together into some creation such as roof, lawn, etc. Lastly, the final step is data storytelling in which someone is playing with a lego house." width="550"}](https://www.effectivedatastorytelling.com/post/a-deeper-dive-into-lego-bricks-and-data-stories)

## Environment You Deserve {.smaller}

Macalester College values diversity and inclusion.

::: incremental
-   I am committed to a climate of mutual respect, free of discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender identity, religion, sexual orientation, disability, and other identities, in and out of the classroom. This class strives to be a learning environment that is usable, equitable, inclusive, and welcoming.

-   To help support these goals, I expect you to follow the [MSCS Community Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/u/3/d/e/2PACX-1vSlLLWmyOf8WKGDKJ_qypgA_kQI1dNFGEKH0mtFoqfAUARZN7ypVCgivnmPjccks9jJzW1rgEzt7QMI/pub).

-   These guidelines were created by the MSCS faculty and staff in our ongoing efforts to create a community that is more welcoming, supportive, and inclusive.
:::

## Environment You Deserve

::: incremental
-   **Respect:** *regard the feelings, wishes, experiences, and traditions of others as individuals*

-   **Empathy:** *try to sense and understand others' emotions and feelings*

-   **Start with Curiosity:** *don't assume; instead, ask a question*

-   **Supportive Community:** *you are not learning in isolation but rather, in a community ready to help and assist each other*
